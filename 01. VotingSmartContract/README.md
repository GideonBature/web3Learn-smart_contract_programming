## VotingSmartContract

The "VotingSmartContract" project showcases a smart contract that allows individuals to vote during a specific voting period. The contract keeps track of the votes cast by each address and ensures that each address can only vote once. Additionally, the contract enforces a minimum balance requirement for voting.

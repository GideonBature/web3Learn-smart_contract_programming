## ERC721_OpenZeppelin

The "ERC721_OpenZeppelin" project demonstrates the usage of the OpenZeppelin library to create ERC721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes the following contract:

`Hellonft`: This contract extends the `ERC721` contract from OpenZeppelin and represents a non-fungible token called "HelloNft" (HNFT). It includes a mapping to keep track of ownership records for each address. The contract allows users to mint new tokens by calling the `mintToken` function, which assigns a new unique token ID and associates it with the recipient's address.

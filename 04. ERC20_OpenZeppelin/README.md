## ERC20_OpenZeppelin

The "ERC20_OpenZeppelin" project demonstrates the usage of the OpenZeppelin library to create ERC20 tokens. It includes three contracts:

1. `GDCToken`: This contract extends the `ERC20` contract from OpenZeppelin and represents a custom token called "Gid Coin" (GDC). It sets the initial token supply during contract deployment.

2. `ERC20FixedSupply`: This contract extends the `ERC20` contract from OpenZeppelin and represents a fixed supply token called "Fixed" (FIX). It mints 1000 tokens during contract deployment.

3. `ERC20WithMinerReward`: This contract extends the `ERC20` contract from OpenZeppelin and represents a token called "Reward" (RWD) with a miner reward feature. It allows the contract owner to mint 1000 tokens and reward them to the miner of the current block.

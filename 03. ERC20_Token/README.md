## ERC20_Token

The "ERC20_Token" project implements a basic ERC20 token smart contract. It represents a custom token called "Gid Coin" (GDC) with a total supply specified during contract deployment. The contract allows users to transfer tokens, check their balances, and approve token transfers to other addresses. It follows the ERC20 standard and emits events for transfers and approvals.

## ERC271_AccessControl

The "ERC271_AccessControl" project demonstrates an access control mechanism implemented using the ERC271 standard. The smart contract allows an owner to set roles for specific addresses, granting them certain permissions. Only addresses with the assigned roles or the contract owner can perform specific operations such as addition and subtraction.
